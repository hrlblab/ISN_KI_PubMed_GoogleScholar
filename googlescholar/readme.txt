## Instruction of generating Figure 2
**Step 1** 

Use "Publish or Perish" to query the publications'(https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish) information. Save the results in json files. The json file name is the key word (label) that you want to display in the figure.

**Step 2** 

Run the script to get the growth rate and total numbers of publications for each label, then display them in the figure. The figure includes two parts. Figure (a) shows the labels whose total number is larger than a threshold. Figure (b) shows the rest of the labels and clusters them into four groups.
